# Audiovisual Core

<p class="lead">Audiovisual Core is a <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/">TDWG</a> standard maintained by the <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/community/ac/">Audiovisual Core Maintenance Interest Group</a>. It includes a <a href="termlist/">main vocabulary</a> and several controlled vocabularies, as well as several guides that explain how the vocabularies should be used. The purpose of Audiovisual Core is to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections, and to make it possible for users to determine whether those resources would be fit for some biodiversity science application before acquiring the media.</p>
