## 1 Introduction (informative)

This document includes terms intended to be used as controlled values for the Audiovisual Core terms `ac:subjectOrientation` and `ac:subjectOrientationLiteral`. A [JSON-LD representation](https://tdwg.github.io/rs.tdwg.org/cvJson/acorient.json) (including translations to multiple languages) of this SKOS Concept Scheme is available. For more information about how to use this vocabulary, see the [subjectPart and subjectOrientation Controlled Vocabularies User Guide](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/views_user_guide.pdf).

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

Section 1 is informative (non-normative).

Section 2 is normative except as noted.

Section 3 is informative.

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI`, `Definition`, and `Controlled value` are normative. The value of `Usage` (if it exists for a given term) is normative.  The value of `Has broader concept` is normative. The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties (such as `Examples` or `Notes`) are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp14) [\[RFC 2119\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119) and [\[RFC 8174\]](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

### 1.3 User feedback reports
For perspective on the development of this [vocabulary enhancement](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#4-vocabulary-enhancements), refer to the [final Feature Report](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/final-requirements.md) used to determine the requirements for the vocabulary. The Implementation Experience Report was published in *Biodiversity Information Science and Standards* 7:e94188 and is available at <http://doi.org/10.3897/biss.7.94188>

## 2 Use of Terms

### 2.1 Relationship of value types to property terms

In accordance with the [Audiovisual Core Term List](http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/termlist/) document, unabbreviated term IRIs MUST be used as values of the property `ac:subjectOrientation`. Controlled value strings SHOULD be used as values of the property `ac:subjectOrientationLiteral`.

### 2.2 Relationships with other concept schemes and collections (informative)

Particular `ac:subjectOrientation` values are appropriate for some `ac:subjectPart` values. The relationships between concepts in these two schemes are described by a [JSON-LD serialized SKOS Collection for each subject part](https://tdwg.github.io/rs.tdwg.org/cvJson/acorient_collection.json) that designates which subject orientations are appropriate for that part. Similarly, [JSON-LD serialized SKOS Collections have been established for some organism groups](https://tdwg.github.io/rs.tdwg.org/cvJson/acpart_collection.json) to indicate which subject parts exist for members of those groups. These collections are provided to aid application developers in filtering the concepts that should be presented to users and they may also be used for validation.

Human-readable collection lists of controlled value strings are available for [subjectPart](https://ac.tdwg.org/part_collections) and [subjectOrientation](https://ac.tdwg.org/orient_collections).

Neither of these Collections are normative and they are maintained outside of the Audiovisual Core standards framework in order to make their development agile.
