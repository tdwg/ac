**Abstract:** Audiovisual Core uses the terms `ac:variant` and `ac:variantLiteral` to provide information about the size, extent, and availability of the Service Access Point of a media item. This controlled vocabulary provides values for those terms.

## 1 Introduction (informative)

This document includes terms intended to be used as a controlled value for Audiovisual Core terms `ac:variant` and `ac:variantLiteral`.

### 1.1 Status of the content of this document

Section 1 is informative (non-normative).

Section 2 is normative.

Section 3 is informative (non-normative).

In Section 4, the values of the `Term IRI`, `Definition`, and `Controlled value` are normative. The value of `Usage` (if it exists for a given term) is normative. The values of `Term Name` are non-normative, although one can expect that the namespace abbreviation prefix is one commonly used for the term namespace.  `Label` and the values of all other properties are non-normative.

### 1.2 RFC 2119 key words
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## 2 Use of Terms

### 2.1 Relationship of value types to property terms

In accordance with [the Audiovisual Core Term List document](http://rs.tdwg.org/ac/doc/termlist/), unabbreviated term IRIs SHOULD be used as values of the property `ac:variant`. Controlled value strings SHOULD be used as values of the property `ac:variantLiteral`.

### 2.2 Relationship between values of ac:variantLiteral and ac:variant

An IRI for a term in this vocabulary denotes the same concept as the concept denoted by the controlled value string for the same term. Thus a client MAY infer an IRI value for `ac:variant` given a controlled value string for `ac:variantLiteral` even if that IRI is not explicitly stated. The practical implication is that data aggregators MAY materialize values for the preferred `ac:variant` property in cases where providers only provide values for `ac:variantLiteral`.
