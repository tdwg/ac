# Fungi terms

These terms were proposed by @jbstatgen. Theri metadata are in the `subjectPart_cv.csv` file included in this directory. There 

## fungi
<ul>
<li>unspecifiedPart</li>
<li>entireOrganism</li>
<li>mycelium</li>
<li>thallus</li>
<li>fruitingBody</li>
<li>vegetativeReproductiveStructure</li>
<li>symboiont</li>
</ul>

Fungal terms were discussed in [Issue 240](). However, there were some [unanswered questions](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/240#issuecomment-1135115594) that were not satisfactorily resolved prior to completing the initial submission of the controlled vocabularies, and the terms weren't tested on images. Therefore they were not included in the initial submission. They may be included at some future time when the issues involving them are worked out.
