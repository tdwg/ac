p0041,mycelium,,p,A mass of hyphae constituting the body (thallus) of a fungus,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FAO_0000011,,"The definition was taken from Alexopoulos, Mims, Blackwell 1996. Wikipedia(EN) notes that a mycelium often shows a root-like, branching, thread-like appearance.","mycorhizal mycelium, mycelium observed in a petri dish",mycelium,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
p0042,thallus,,p,"A relatively simple plant body devoid of stems, roots, and leaves; in fungi formed in the somatic phase",http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FAO_0000034,"In this definition the term can be used for bryophytes, ferns and fungi.","The definition was taken from Alexopoulos, Mims, Blackwell 1996. In lichenology the term is specifically used to describe the main body of lichens.",,thallus,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
p0043,fruiting body,,p,A general term for spore-bearing organs in both macrofungi and microfungi,http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FAO_0000007,,"The definition was taken from Kirk et al. 2001. The term is under discussion within the mycological community. Proposed alternative terms are: ""sporocarp"" (still too close to plants, ie. -carp) or ""sporom"". Alexopoulos, Mims, Blackwell 1996 define fruiting body as ""any complex fungal structure that contains or bears spores; a sporocarp"".","apothecium, ascoma (ascocarp), basidioma (basidiocarp), conidioma, perithecium, sporocarp (all from Kirk et al. 2001), mushroom",fruitingBody,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
p0044,vegetative reproductive structure,,p,Specialized structure that produces vegetative propagules,,,"This term is most often used in lichenology and describes structures in which propagules are produces which generally contain and disperse both symbiontic partners together, e.g. soralia, isidia. However, (in lichenology) the term is also used for conidioma, which vegetatively produce fungal conidia","soralia, isidia",vegetativeReproductiveStructure,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
p0045,symbiont,,p,A partner in an association between different organisms,,,"A term is most often used for partners in coevolved associations, specifically for mutualisms. However, at the extreme, also invasive fungal pathogens that might drive their host(s) (close) to extinction can be considered symbionts, which are at the very beginning of a coevolutionary process (cp. e.g. European ash and the ascomycete that is the cause of ash dieback disease. In mycology and lichenology the term is often used for the autotroph partner of a fungus, e.g. a plant, alga or cyanobacterium. However, also heterotroph bacteria seem to be living in close symbiosis with fungi.","tree, grass (root), algal cells, pine, cyanobacterial filaments",symboiont,http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#Concept
