# Bryophyte terms

These terms were proposed by Mervin Perez.

<ul>
<li>unspecifiedPart</li>
<li>entireOrganism</li>
<li>stem</li>
<li>leaf</li>
<li>archegoniophore</li>
<li>antheridiophore</li>
<li>antheridium</li>
<li>archegonium</li>
<li>gemmaCup</li>
<li>thallus</li>
<li>sporophyte</li>
</ul>

Their metadata are included in the `subjectPart_cv.csv` spreadsheet in this directory. However, those metadata don't include links to an ontology, so that would need to be done.

In [Issue 235](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/235), @nielsklazenga raised some issues about the proposed terms that were not adequately addressed. @baskaufs suggested testing the terms using images listed in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1onX9qnwfcSWM5rxt2b-8A7oLx2xBPG09QPZUzyKJCso/edit?usp=sharing), but that was never done.

@afuchs1 [suggested the following values](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/235#issuecomment-1135260745) that she uses to categorize bryophyte parts in an image:

```
GAMETOPHYTE
SPOROPHYTE
SPORE
SPORANGIA
THALLUS
FRUITING_BODY
```
