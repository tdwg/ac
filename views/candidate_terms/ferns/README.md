# Fern terms

These terms were proposed by Mervin Perez. Theri metadata are in the `subjectPart_cv.csv` file included in this directory. However, those metadata are lacking references to ontologies (the `definition_derived_from` column).

## ferns
<ul>
<li>unspecifiedPart</li>
<li>entireOrganism</li>
<li>sori</li>
<li>rhizome</li>
<li>leaf</li>
</ul>

Issues related to these terms are [Issue 235](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/235), [Issue 236](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/236), and [Issue 238](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/238). Given that they were not satisfactorily resolved prior to completing the initial submission of the controlled vocabularies, they were not included. They may be included at some future time when the issues involving them are worked out.
