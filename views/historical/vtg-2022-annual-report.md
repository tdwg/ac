## Phase of work:
The Views Controlled Vocabularies Task Group is chartered under the Audubon Core 
Maintenance Group. It is tasked with developing controlled vocabularies for the Audubon 
Core terms `ac:subjectPart` and `ac:subjectOrientation`, which are sometimes collectively 
referred to as a "view". 

The Task Group has completed its work and its deliverables are currently under public review. See [the term addition proposal](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/245) for details and public comments thus far.

## Activities:
- The Task Group met twice since the 2021 annual report was submitted. The notes for those meetings can be viewed in the group's [historical documents directory](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/tree/master/views/historical) of its GitHub repository.
- We finalized the two controlled vocabularies, then developed guidelines for implementation testing. We conducted a workshop on 9 February for potential test implementers.  
- Implementation testing was carried out during March and April and feedback was collected using a Google Form.
- The implementation testing results were assembled into an Implementation Experience Report as required by the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification (VMS), [Section 4.2.2](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#422-implementation-experience-report). The test implementers were invited to co-author this report as a publication in TDWG's journal BISS. 
- The finalized proposal was submitted to the AC issues tracker in preparation for the public comment period, which began on October 31 and will run until at least 7 December.


## Accomplishments:
- Created [Notes for test implementers](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/views_cv_testing_notes.pdf), which effectively serves as a user guide.
- Compiled the [final requirements](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/final-requirements.md) to serve as the Feature Report required by the VMS, [Section 4.2.1](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#421-feature-report).
- Submitted the Implementation Experience Report as an article to BISS. The submitted final draft can be viewed [here](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/implementation_experience_report_submitted_20582.pdf).
- Finalized the [draft subjectPart controlled vocabulary](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/code/subjectPart/subjectPart.md) and [draft subjectOrientation controlled vocabulary](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/views/code/subjectOrientation/subjectOrientation.md) for submission to the AC Maintenance Group to initiate public comment.
- Created a number of ancillary supporting documents, which group the subjectPart values by organism group and the subjectOrientation values by subject part. These materials are available as CSV tables, machine-readable JSON-LD, and human readable lists. The labels and definitions are available in machine-readable form in both Spanish and English. For a complete list of these documents, see the [Ancillary documents section of the proposal](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/245) for links.

## Impediments to progress
None.

## Changes in goals or scope
None.

## Plans for next calendar year
Once the vocabularies are ratified, the convener will work with the Audubon Core Maintenance Group to move the draft documentation into the AC website.
