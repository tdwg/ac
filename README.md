# Audiovisual Core (AC)

This is the main entry point to the work of the Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group.  If you are looking for the landing page of the standard itself, go to <https://www.tdwg.org/standards/ac/>. To find the website containing the standards documents, go to <https://ac.tdwg.org/>.

The Audiovisual Core (AC), previously known as Audubon Core, is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.

The current release (2022-02-23) is archived at <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6590205"><img src="https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.6590205.svg" alt="DOI"></a>

## The Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group

Audiovisual Core is maintained by a specialized [Interest Group](http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/process/) whose [charter](audiovisual-core_maintenance-group_charter.md) was approved in January 2018.  The functions of the Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration).  In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard.  As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard. The Maintenance Group generally meets on the third Wednesday of the month.

## Core Members of the AC Maintenance Group

Currently, core members of the group are:

Ed Baker - Natural History Museum, London, UK (Convener) - [edward.baker@nhm.ac.uk](mailto:edward.baker@nhm.ac.uk)

To see all of the people who are paying attention to our work, see the list of ["watchers"](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/watchers).  The people on this list are effectively the "regular members" of the group.

The Maintenance Group would like to recognize Robert A. Morris who passed away in 2021. Bob can be considered the "father of Audiovisual Core" and led the task group through the development and process of ratifying of the standard. Thanks, Bob, for your vision and leadership!

## Task Groups

In the [TDWG Process](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/) for creating and modifying standards, Task Groups are formed to create particular deliverables of interest to an Interest Group.  As an Interest Group, the Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group periodically establishes Task Groups.

We have chartered a 3D Imagery and Data Task Group (3DTG) to look at possible additions to Audiovisual Core for describing 3D images.  For more information, see the [Task Group's home page](3d/README.md).  If you are interested in the work of this group, contact its convener, [Doug Boyer](mailto:douglasmb@gmail.com).

We have also chartered a Views Controlled Vocabularies task group to create controlled vocabularies for `ac:subjectPart` and `ac:subjectOrientation`.  For more information, see the [Task Group's home page](views/README.md).  If you are interested in the work of this group, contact its convener, [Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu).

## Participating in the Maintenance Group

If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members.

To participate in the communication system of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues).  This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.

### Maintenance Group Meetings

The Maintenance Group meets via Zoom, usually at 17:00 UTC, on the third Wednesday of the month. These meetings are open to anyone interested in joining; please contact the convenor for the Zoom link. [Next meeting agenda](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22next+meeting+agenda%22).

## Policies

Policies established by the Maintenance Group are listed [here](policies.md).  Please note that the policy document is not included with the Audiovisual Core Standard and is therefore not subject to any standards-related processes requiring public comment, Executive Committee approval, etc. Rather, the policies are established through consensus of the Maintenance Group, in consultation (when necessary) with the [Technical Architecture Group](https://github.com/tdwg/tag).

## Term and website translation

### For users

The Audiovisual Core website is available in multiple languages, see the "文A" menu.

Translations in machine-readable format are in the [rs.tdwg.org repository](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org), you will need several files:

* [Iptc4xmpExt-for-ac/Iptc4xmpExt-for-ac-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/Iptc4xmpExt-for-ac/Iptc4xmpExt-for-ac-translations.csv)
* [ac-for-dwc/ac-for-dwc-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/ac-for-dwc/ac-for-dwc-translations.csv)
* [acorient/acorient-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/acorient/acorient-translations.csv)
* [acpart/acpart-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/acpart/acpart-translations.csv)

* [dwc-for-ac/dwc-for-ac-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/dwc-for-ac/dwc-for-ac-translations.csv)
* [exif-for-ac/exif-for-ac-translations.csv](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/exif-for-ac/exif-for-ac-translations.csv)

### For translators

Translations are managed within Crowdin, which makes it easy to keep up with any changes to Darwin Core.  If you wish to contribute please go to the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/darwin-core) and request to join, then email the Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group.

The Crowdin project has two sections:

* `[tdwg.rs.tdwg.org] translations` – this contains term definitions for several standards.  Audiovisual Core's definitions are labelled "Audiovisual Core", corresponding to the list of files just above.
* `[tdwg.ac] master` — this contains the website, such as the home page, navigation menu, and the text surrounding the lists of terms.

Translating `navigation.json` first is recommended, as you will then be able to browse the preview site at https://ac-translation-preview.tdwg.org/.

To avoid conflicts, **edits to translations should only be made in Crowdin**.

### For developers of this website

Translations of term data (labels, definitions, examples, comments) are retrieved from the [rs.tdwg.org repository](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org), see [rs.tdwg.org/TRANSLATIONS.md](https://github.com/tdwg/rs.tdwg.org/blob/master/TRANSLATIONS.md) for details on that process.

Translations of the rest of the Audiovisual Core website (guides, prose sections, navigation menu etc) is managed here.  [crowdin.yml](crowdin.yml) configures files required for translation, and as content is translated Crowdin will create pull requests.  The only manual edits required are for building a new language (configured at the top of [build/build-website.py](build/build-website.py) and, once the translation is ready, adding it to the end of the [navigation menu](docs/_data/navigation.json).

GitHub Actions are configured to rebuild the website automatically as website/prose translations are created and updated.  Changes are automatically deployed to https://ac-translation-preview.tdwg.org/, when the pull request is approved they will appear on https://ac.tdwg.org/.  (Note if the navigation menu hasn't been translated it will be necessary to edit the URL to get to each page.)
